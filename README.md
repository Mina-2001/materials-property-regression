# materials-property-regression

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis and regression modelling of material property datasets. The aim is to investigate the relationships between various chemical and physical features, clean and visualise the data, and build predictive models using Python.

## Overview

Using a dataset containing periodic properties, melting points, energy gaps, and other elemental features, we:

- Cleaned and filtered extreme outliers using threshold-based removal.
- Visualised feature distributions using boxplots.
- Analysed inter-feature correlation via Pearson heatmaps.
- Identified redundant features and dropped those with high correlation.
- Applied linear regression to predict the `gllbsc_gap` target variable.
- Evaluated model performance with scatter plots of predicted vs actual values.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Outcome

This project demonstrates an end-to-end regression workflow for materials informatics â€” from cleaning and visualisation to modelling and evaluation.
